# Changes to stat data

- Cycle 13
  - changed salmonax's team play rating of asantos from 2 to 4
- Cycle 14/15
  - cycle 14 is registered as cycle 15 in the database
    - so every stat file that says 15 really should be 14
  - had to remove project "warlike-jaeger" in order to calc stats
    - because only 1/3 team members submitted a retro, so no stats could be calculated (Devon did, Isis + Majid didn't)
