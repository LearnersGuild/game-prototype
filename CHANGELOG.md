# Changes to stat data

- Cycle 13
  - changed salmonax's team play rating of asantos from 2 to 4
- Cycle 14
  - had to remove project "warlike-jaeger" in order to calc stats
    - because only 1/3 team members submitted a retro, so no stats could be calculated (Devon did, Isis + Majid didn't)
- Cycle 18
  - omitted projects 'disturbed-grison' and 'ablaze-coot' due to missing retros
