We began to work well together later on in the week once I realized that I could learn by working well with you. 

You know a lot more then you realize you know. You do not have to self deprecate as much you do :)

I want to work with you because you have lots of skill and we started to work well together towards the end of the week. 

I would want to work with you more if you were able to acknowledge others' existence on your team at the time when you are focused on an issue. Just a hey whats up or can we do something together?"

It was great working with them because the scope of how much she remembers across frameworks and languages is beautiful. She is super sharp and taught me a lot of best practices even as a learner.  Aileen also doesn't know how to necessarily focus and I think at times would get lost down rabbit holes to complete things that weren't on our specs. I think if we had concentrated on creating specs and finishing them, we would have completed a lot.

Mihai is still learning how to communicate without being a teacher and more importantly finishing what they started. I think it was super hard to work with Mihai because he we was very wrapped in the other group as if they were his first priority and we were second. And then I think he was less into learning and more into doing what he already knew how to do and showing us. There were times when we disagreed on information sharing which we cleared. I would want to work with Mihai more if he was more reflective about him unlearning the role as teacher and finished things he said he was going to finish. For example, we did a cog apprenticeship which we included as a goal getting our info from back end into view on front end. In the beginning he said it would take 60-90 minutes, we didn't finish and Devon ended up helping us in the end completing that task that we had agreed to do with Mihai. I also know Mihai had another group that was probably taking a lot of emotional and intellectual energy so I sympathize."

I believe giving you the feedback and taking some of the feedback from you this week, helped me relax tremendously about this program and this project. I believe that mentally it is tough to not allow mental stories cloud my judgment and be able to focus on what I am doing.

I want to work with you because you because I feel like I finally understand more about your thought process and I was able to get my questions clarified along the way. I am sorry if I changed trains of thought too much when you or another teammate were trying to focus on something.

I would want to work with you more if you were able to give us time to work as teammates but also come in and give guidance on how to fix a particular issue and then continue on to next issue and guide in terms of what we should research next."

It was initially very hard to communicate and make decisions with you because you failed to realize my viewpoint as different and valid. However, with a lot of discussion we moved past that unto more important tasks. I appreciate you coming each day with a positive attitude. I enjoyed working with you because you were willing to be honest. I would want to work with you more even if we are challenged more than we were with this project. You made me better with the human aspect of being a developer."
