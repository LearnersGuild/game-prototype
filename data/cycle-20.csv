It took a lot of might, will power, and courage to face some of the challenges that came about this week. Keep doing what you did. Even though there were arguments/disagreements, you didn't give up. To me (and I'm sure many other people), that means a lot. Some call it integrity or character.

Even though it was a peculiar week due to the holiday, we still managed to get a lot done. Thanks for being patient in your learning support! Even though our ELO's are very different I think that we still managed to take a lot away from each other. I'd definitely want to work with you more if we could have more focus. It was so helpful when we communicated our distinct learner styles and got with the program pretty quickly. That offset many times when we'd be distracted, and we were able to get back to the project. It's also nice to see that you enjoy what you're doing for the most part and that really shows through in your team play."

There were a few things I might have appreciated if they'd not been undermined by other aspects of the work dynamic. E.g., you _may_ be knowledgeable. However, your work was mostly opaque to me, being done in silence and with little clear explanation. Additionally, I was very challenged by the task of keeping us and our work on same page. I believe this was due to your consistent failure to accurately/meaningfully estimate when you'd complete something you'd chosen to handle. I think that created many blocking situations."

I enjoyed the walk you, myself and other guild-mates took during the week and I'm glad you had trust enough in us to communicate what you felt was on your heart and mind to say. I think you've lead  and are still living a tougher life than most but you're also capable of much more than you think. As far as your learning and better understanding of JS I hope we were able to make clear a sound strategy for you to utilize to get the results and the learning you want. As for life advice, just like your studies communication and close bonds make the ultimate difference. Envision not just graduating from the guild but attracting a more positive and rewarding future after June 2017. You'll do great."

You set out a clear vision for the bookstore and set goals that allowed for both of us to grow. You also allowed us to work autonomously on areas that were our strengths with the idea of pair programming once that structure was in place (we just did not have enough time to implement that). You also told the truth and were focused on our work. I would like to work with you more if we had a longer week and if we had the opportunity to pair program.
