1. Belonging Tension (They were in relationship with me. They cared for the quality of our working relationship, and paid attention to it.) 
 An example of this is when you would disagree with me about preferences in writing code: eliminating semi-colons, adding a space at the end of a component’s closing bracket. You questioned my ideas 80% of the time and I often had to prove that my ideas were equally valid. I felt that I had to clear my ideas with you before they could be implemented in our code. At the end of the day, these opinions/preferences took away from our ability to work as a team and accomplish tasks together. 
I was mindful of working better with you and would sacrifice my ideas to make sure yours were heard, whenever I did so there was less friction and time spent idly arguing over opinions.
My feedback for you here is focus on getting to the right answer together and making everyone in your team feel valued and that their ideas are validated.
2. Friction Reduction (They were constantly looking for ways to improve team process, and to help everyone play to their full potential.)
An example of this is when you would disagree with me without asking more questions to fully understand my ideas. You were very focused on the ‘rightness’ of a programming concept. You argued with me about whether a function was an expression or a declaration when I had already told you the ‘right’ answer. You were not focused on helping to improve team process by avoiding unnecessary and emotionally draining arguments. There are many ways to do a task in Javascript so claiming that your way is the right way is not useful in a team. 
3. Flexible Leadership (They stepped into leadership roles when needed, and supported others to step into leading roles.)
An example of this is, during our first few days working together, you shut my ideas down by telling me, “You are wrong.” Your words and communication style did not support me in stepping into leadership roles. You were quick to give criticism but not as quick at giving supporting or encouraging words.
My feedback for you here is to incorporate more inclusive language into your communication, communicate with your team mate in the way they can best grow and learn, and encourage/support them through words. 
4. Receptiveness (They were open to feedback, and received it gracefully without becoming defensive or dismissive. They separated their ego from their work.)
When I gave you feedback, I told it to you objectively while exposing my own vulnerability. You were especially defensive and dismissive about feedback on how to work with team mates who do not come from the same level of privilege and identity. 
My feedback to you here is to be more open to feedback, especially about privilege, gender, race and culture and how this plays in to team dynamics."

I thought you did a really great job of being flexible, and putting the project first. I learned a lot from working with you this week but I also want to suggest another format if we get to pair again, because it strikes me that we could have worked even better together.  What I want to suggest is that since I'm super comfortable doing back end stuff and you're super comfortable doing front end stuff that we should actually let the person who is less comfortable with a particular task drive. That way the person who is more comfortable can focus on explaining their reasoning for things while the driver executes their ideas, and hopefully we'll be able to stay better engaged when we're doing something we dont feel as comfortable with. I think if we work that way we'll be able to help each other become better quicker."

I learned a lot when you explained your approach for solving problems. I appreciated that you made time to have check-ins about our project, and about our individual struggles within the project. You created a safe place for me to express my lack of knowledge and you were able to receive feedback well throughout the week. I appreciated when I was able to drive and you navigated, this helped me grasp how to set up a solution much quicker then studying a finished solution. I also appreciate that we were able to solve the problems with multiple methods, and that you valued learning various approaches instead of quickly completing the project.

I would want to work with you more if you listened more when we were problem solving together. I felt that there were moments where my approaches were under-explored initially, and only after solving the problem with your approach did we go back and try another way. This worked well in the beginning, although it felt somewhat limiting towards the end."

I felt that the way you were emotionally open made me connect with you more as a partner and really made this week the best one I've had. I appreciate that you encouraged me to take a new break system, and it really did help me stay focused. I'll be implementing it from now on. It was great that everyone around us started to dance as well. I like that we were able to go at your pace when we were writing React components, and I still didn't feel like I was being useless.Your technical skill is also at a level I appreciate, and it is good to see what a few weeks in React land can do for someone's understanding of it."

That said you've been crushing it lately so this isn't a big deal. I think I have a pretty good sense of what you can accomplish in a week. I'd enjoy working with you more if we touched base more often during the week. I have a sense you try to avoid ""bothering me"". If thats the case lets fix that so we can communicate more during the week. 

You're showing a ton of improvement week over week Nico. Lets try and work together a bit more during the week so we can power level you :)"

I think we evenly contributed and when I had questions you were very helpful in clearing up my confusion. If you didn't have an answer you were very proactive on finding an answer or reaching out for help.  You also showed me some awesome resources to help me outside the scope of the project. I would want to work with you more if... and this is really nit picking but I felt like at times you could be more aggressive. I may be reading into this but I felt maybe you wanted to say or try something but hesitated. However that only happened a few times.(Honestly I am stretching to give some sort of critique.)

I felt like I often was accidentally leading the way or taking complete control over the direction of the project, and when asking you for your opinion I struggled to gauge your enthusiasm. I would have felt more settled if you offered reassurance upon agreeing to move away from react and back to standard node, if that indeed was what you wanted, and if it wasn't what you wanted, would appreciate being corrected.

I enjoyed our flow, and I think our skillsets really complimented each other and lead to us accomplishing a good deal. I appreciated how focused and on task you were, and your communication style helped us to navigate forks in the road and challenges.

On thing I observed in both of us this week was being a little lax on time integrity: showing up a little late for morning standup, and returning from breaks a little later than we agreed. I’d challenge you (just as I’m challenging myself) to treat this like a first job and really turn up the heat in that regard.

Awesome week with you!"

This week you and James were focusing on your React basics. You also started a task that turned out to be much harder than I anticipated.

I was really stretched this week but I never felt overwhelmed because you were fun to work with and were generous with your knowledge on everything from SQL to general setup. I had a really great time on this project and like that we also constantly checked in with one another on how we were feeling and also that we took breaks when we were super stuck or getting frustrated with the code. I had such a great time I dont think I have any ""constructive feedback"" Id love to work with you again. :]"
