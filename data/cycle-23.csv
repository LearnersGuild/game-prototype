This makes our learning more efficient and I would want to work with you more if you pushed your level of understanding on a few technical areas to a point where you feel more comfortable teaching others. Currently, it seems that you're learning topics to complete a task. For example, if you're learning a new topic. I would copy the code in a new text editor and make changes. Have a clear idea of the outcome you would expect, then console.log to see if you are right. I think tactics like this will really help your understanding and might help you share your immense knowledge with others."

Working with you was awesome because you really wanted to dive deep and understand every part of the code. I appreciated your constant words of encouragement and positive attitude. You're one of the best team players i've worked with and I really appreciated you helping me out with my leadership skills and confidence!

You were engaged in our work and you kept us moving at a level pace. You gave me space (and a reasonable, agreed-upon time limit) to try to figure out solutions while honoring your own needs. I really appreciated that. I also liked that you sought out support from pro players on a regular basis. Seeking out support with team members has helped me grow and recognize my own need for it, and I thank you. I would work with you again anytime though I would encourage you to try to bring up outside time commitments on the first day of future projects (it did not affect me in any way, but it may affect future partners)."

I enjoyed learning this new paradigm with you, and I think we did a great job of navigating the somewhat ambiguous project.  I appreciate how flexible you were at various points, like being flexible around doing the OSS project I was initially assigned to. You were open and honest, and I felt I could trust you to share if you had any issues around the way we were working. 

One little thing to watch for: we both observed you get a little laser-focused at the end of Friday. It wasn’t problematic in the context of our team (you were responsive when I suggested a break, and your focus also resulted in you completing our challenge!); just something to watch for in the future.

PS I still wanna see the video of your band!"

Your focus and intense dedication are something that I wish everyone had more of! You helped us roll through all the unexpected curveballs, especially regarding Git and the DB challenges. 

Thanks for being patient with my impatience. I'm thankful that you're in House Kraken and that your well-rounded and impressive skills include a great eye and flow with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

I would want to work with you more if you would pause more to check in with your teammate(s). Please communicate any worries about the project more directly and especially when you feel as if you want to take over unfinished aspects and anything that hasn't gone as planned.

Tension had built up toward the end of the week and we didn't communicate as well as we could have. HOWEVER, there was Friday and I really appreciated our trio's conversation. 

Thanks for being open to feedback and providing good feedback in return. I appreciated that we had a mature conversation about everything that went on during the week. I'll gladly work with you again, especially on something that's more front-end based as I know that we could learn more from each other and make all the things look beautiful."

Overall, I am really proud of the team's progress and process because we spent time accomplishing our goals and learning about things that continued to stump more experienced players. I also like our end product.

Okay, here goes:

I want to work with you because you are close to your code, aware of your intentions for what you have written and able to explain it clearly. You were also driven to contribute even when you weren't feeling well. In the beginning I felt like I wanted to spend more time figuring things out together before asking for outside help, but when it was time to switch from React, you were open. I also noticed that you were more open to diving in towards the end of the week, which I appreciated. When I pushed to spend a little more time on event listeners, you went with it.

I come from a more object-oriented coding background, so I am adapting to functional programming as well as Javascript. I hope I will have a better grasp on functional programming if/when we work together again. I'd also be curious to see what either of us would learn if we took considered and/or applied object-oriented programming to a coding project. Regarding team play, I felt like you showed strong leadership and problem-solving. I think you absorbed my ideas better when I wrote them out in pseudo-code or when someone else was there to help with communication. I could also tell that you were making an effort to be patient and present even when it was challenging for you. Our minds work in similar ways when approaching logic, so I look forward to working together when we both have more experience supporting stuck teammates and coding."

You are at ease with everything, and yet you still keep gears towards the project. You have a zen-like quality of balance between the tensions of fun and engagement; You push both forwards at the same time, I want to learn to mimic you on this. I very much enjoyed your thought process. You admit your weaknesses, and you work around them. You don't complain about them, nor do you needlessly bash your head on your weaknesses trying to improve at something you may just not have an innate ability to do.. instead you take the wiser route, working around. Specifically, you recognize that you learn best by diving into code, instead of reading material. Instead of taking some people's advice and just ""forcing"" yourself to read, which you could get better at slowly, you learn by doing what you DO know how to do. Coding. If the end result is the same (learning the concept) then you're taking the correct approach. Some people will tell you that you need to learn to read documents. Sure, do it if you have to. But don't lose your wisdom to know when you get more benefit from doing it your way. I myself learned a lot by watching how you code Things. Finally, I absolutely loved how you allowed me to do my own thing, and then we paired later, after I understood the content better. You seem to have a perfect balance on ""teaching"" *as* you code, without slowing down as Shareef says."

Your innate desire to test and break things had me thinking more critically and about how I could make my own code more secure and solid. The way you mathematically approach things was incredibly valuable to the project. My only criticism isn't much of a criticism, and its something I myself am still working on. Things can sometimes be simpler than we originally think lol. I think we both had a tendency to assume complex solutions and perhaps we may need to assume things to be simple before we complicate it."

As for major things you could improve on, I think it's stuff you're already very aware of.  Specifically what you said on Friday about not needing to know how your engine works to drive a car."

This made me feel more connected on a personal level. You were good at stepping into a leadership role when initiating 30 minute talks at the beginning and end of the day.
I wish we had been able to really do some paired learning together, I think there is value in your methods and I would have liked to learn from them. As we discussed on Thursday, it seems that there was confusion when you had said that you wanted to take the role of a project manager for the week, and then proceeded to draw out a schedule for us. I assumed this meant that you had planned to keep us on task with our agreed upon methods (solo work Monday and Tuesday, pair work Wednesday and Thursday). I'm disappointed that we did not pair up on Wednesday or Thursday as we had agreed upon on Monday, and I think this is partially due to a miscommunication in what ""project managing"" meant, and partially due to a resistance to do paired work altogether.  
I think there is a lot to be gained from learning how to solve problems as a team, it's one of the reasons I joined LG versus another program. The 30 minute session we had Thursday before you had to leave was not enough to get engaged or to reach flow. I felt very alone in figuring out each problem, and I felt left behind. You are weeks ahead of me and I was looking forward to working with you and learning from you.
I also found it difficult to give you feedback. When I brought up our lack of pairing on Thursday, it was met with resistance and blame shifting. This made it difficult to be vulnerable about my needs and it made it hard to focus on finding a solution (like discussing how we would pair, and what we would work on). I would like to work with you again if I knew that our agreed upon process would be honored, that we would co-learn together, and that my concerns were met with a receptive attitude."

You are also very knowledgeable and I was able to learn a lot from working with you again. I must admit that I have seen your progress from the last time we worked together and am happy to watch you succeed even more in your endeavours as a software developer. Thanks again for making this a great week. It was hard to find any critical feedback, one thing that does come to mind though would be not let yourself discouraged when nothing is making sense, because undoubtedly the code will make sense at some point. I have to work on that as well, and regardless we went up against some difficulties and were able to get through them which is awesome."

while solving a particular problem. For example, the time when you were trying
to solve the time-slices algorithm, I felt like you and Rachel got too deep in
the rabbit hole, which delayed you in finding the solution. It would help if you were to pause and reflect on the solution you have so far, and maybe discuss the

I really did enjoy working with you this week, I just wish I had been healthier throughout the week. The only kind of critical feedback that I could think of was to set your expectations for the week and let us know when we're deviating from that.

From the beginning of agreeing on this project, we both thought this would be an easy project. Boy, we totally underestimated the project which brought out a lot of tenacity and brain power from the both of us. I really enjoyed watching you learn new things (eg.setting the percentages on the images to make our site more mobile friendly). I also enjoyed your personality and how well you handled difficult situations (eg. figuring out the GitHub). Thank you for the lunch and I really look forward to paring with you a couple of time in the future."

Working with you, I can see you understand javascript well enough to put things together.

Here are a few points of controversy that I had in our interactions this week:
1. At the start of our project, you mentioned you knew you needed to work on being able to explain your code, although when I was asking you for explanation, I sensed a level of frustration that was matched with me being left confused on what the code actually meant.
2. There were also times when I had some clear ideas on what the problem might be, based on javascript syntax and/or error content, and my ideas were negated until you were out of ideas and then willing to try what I was saying.
3. When you ask someone to drive, you should allow them to drive, instead of wanting to take control of the keyboard every few minutes. I found this to be frustrating on my part, stemming from what seemed to  be a lack of patience. It seemed to contradict your pet peeve of someone taking control of the keyboard without asking.

The things previously listed caused me to back off from interaction at times, not out of fear, but for sake of progression in both our ZPDs. I felt there was more of a benefit of us learning more about the code  than to argue about the code. This way we could at least be able to discuss the code and/or questions about the code with understanding on both sides. (i.e. answering questions and/or explaining code in a way that either one of us was able to understand)"

I love your drive to learn things thoroughly, your habit of note taking, your not being afraid of diving into new challenging material but quickly finding your way through it all, and lastly I loved that you trusted me to teach the concepts I felt I could rightfully impart unto you during the week. I learned a lot from you and with you, and I know we both leveled up during the past 7 days. 

As for any criticisms I may have had during the week they all vanished thanks to the sheer amount of material and concepts we were able to review in such a short period of time (postgres, sql, express, mongodb, mongoose, and some angular) I had nothing but a great experience. Keep learning."
