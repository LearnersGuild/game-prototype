You kept the intensity and wanted to dive back into again and again. Keep that spirit alive! I really appreciate you separating frustration with our coding problems with possible social frustration. It was the last week before the holidays and we pushed hard as much as we could. I know if it was a full week we would have had more merged.

As I said this week, I would continue to work with you when you continue to be accountable about time commitments. It's a shared agreement we both can continue to be better at."

That being said, I do feel like we both could have been a bit more present in each other code writing and more engaged in pair programming. I love that you are so laid back and enjoy taking code breaks, but I would encourage you to give a little bit more feedback through out the project and check in to see if you are feeling ok about how the collaboration is being structured cause I tend to need that to not completely move at light speed with the project. I never know if im moving too fast or being a code dictator unless something tells me, so that would help me when/if we work together again.

I felt good when you told me you liked when I told you that I liked it when you pointed out every issue you saw and felt more free to say what was on your mind (lol that sentence) I appreciate how quickly you move and felt free to move at my maximum pace. There were a few moments at the end of the week while working on the CSS part that I felt a bit uncomfortable and didn't know what was causing it. It left me feeling like we were not in team. I also felt a little at arms length as to knowing what you were feeling and thinking and I felt less togetherness feelings than I would ideally like.

You're eager to do things in a challenging way that creates a better end product and I really appreciated that eagerness to stretch as well as your friendliness and support. Thinking about places where things could have been smoother, I'd say to try to keep a little more focus when navigating - my brain gets confused when we're working in one file and thinking ahead to the next one unless you're more explicit about which part of the project you're talking about. Overall I think you did very well as a pairing partner so it's a very minor thing."

You challenged me to focus hard on some of my weak points and consistently provided great support on that. Some of our feedback conversations weren't particularly easy, but every single time, I came away feeling like we were on the same page. I greatly appreciate your commitment to our evolving process.

I was definitely in over my head, and your support and receptiveness put me at ease to learn. I appreciate the time you took to explain parts that I did not understand, while also not letting that slow you down. You brought a level of silliness to the project that made it easy to joke around.

I would want to work with your more if you were able to go slow for the setup and explain your intended method (on day 1), then spend the rest of the time going at your ZPD and doing cognitive apprenticeships. By spending more time in the beginning discussing your intended process, and how the project needed to be set up, it would be significantly easier to follow when watching. We jumped into the thick of it immediately, without explanation as to what we were doing. I think this made it unnecessarily difficult to follow your process."

Throughout our project, you spoke out when you didn't know what was going on, and you were honest about your lack of knowledge. This created a safe space for me to be honest, and it allowed us to pull apart our methods. I learned a lot from the answers provided when you asked questions, and towards the end of the week it seems like you understood what was going on much more than you did at the beginning. You also did a great job for reaching out for help from a pro player when we weren't able to figure out the next step. I also enjoyed when we did our drive/navigate for the CSS part. You had a lot of knowledge to contribute, and you were patient as I learned.
On Thursday, you wanted to opt into a solo tutorial review, and I'm glad you didn't. I would encourage you to lean into the discomfort of not knowing what's going on and of not being able to contribute as much as you would like, while trying to absorb and understand as much as you can. You seemed anxious and stressed about this lack of knowledge/contribution, and I would want to work with you more if you met that anxiety with curiosity and fun, with a more optimistic view of what you are gaining, instead of what you are lacking."

With it being a short week, just cleaning up pull requests, and me being sick for a day.  I feel like I didn't involve you in the process as much as I should.

I was a little frustrated at how unfocused we were for the first few days (I think we were both pretty tired), but I think we still got a good amount of work done.

I like your technical knowledge and your willingness to dive into the code and figure things out.  I also think you're very open-minded and easy to talk to."
