So, we've pretty much talked about everything in person already, but it helps to have it in writing.

I know it was a shitty week for you and you're trying to make up your mind about the Guild in general.  You were very disengaged this week, and I feel like I didn't really get a chance to see your skills.  I appreciated your ability to keep up with the work while also reading through the docs, and I thought it was cool that several other learners often came to you for help.

My main actionable feedback is, again, better communication about what your working on, the problems you're trying to solve, setting time limits, etc."

When you say that you will let me know if you need anything out of our partnership, or if anything bothers you, I can count on you to actually let me know. I am excited that you caught onto React so quickly, I appreciate the way you use your time. I appreciate your patience with me this week as I had many meetings and appointments that called me away from our project. A piece of feedback that I can give you that will help you improve is that when you are driving, make sure that you are listening to the navigator and not losing focus and trying your own pieces of code. I don't mind driving the entire week if that is the agreement that we have set, but if you are driving, just make sure that you hold yourself to driving standards.

I thought we were able to have a lot of interesting conversations about code this week. 

There were just some really minor things surrounding focus that I might mention. I felt like sometimes being on the phone at our work space...instead of stepping out for phone conversations... was distracting, or having videos in the background. It really didn't cause too big a problem, but just something to think about. I wish we would have paired more on the last PR we got in, we might have finished it faster and then also could have worked on the user stories. But you came through at the end to work on that with me so that was really great. All and all I had a great time working with you and I hope we get to work togetehr in the future :)"

I would work with you more if you refrain from claiming all the work to be done by you and instead of saying i did it, i completed the work, i did  it all on my own or even when you asked for help you would say i tired and i did this and you wouldn't include me at all. so i felt left out and not included as it made me feel distracted.  i challenge you to include your partners and say we instead of me and try to not loose your temper and avoid speaking loudly were everyone can hear my business."

Socially, you are very open and honest. I appreciate that in you and had fun in conversation with you. But our learning styles are so different, I had trouble reaching my learning potential. It felt more like two people trying to work separately on the same project rather pairing. Even though we were talking to each other while coding, there was some disconnect that I’m not quite sure how to articulate.

I was distracted by the constant coach queuing without asking me first. I do like coaching when we need it, but I think we should try ourselves, and at least have concrete questions to ask the coach.  And I should never be surprised by a coach showing up, or another showing up half an hour after that. It felt dishonest, like you went behind my back to queue up coaches rather than struggle through a problem ourselves. And when, through 8 different coaching sessions, the coaches had written half of our code, it felt the opportunity for learning was actually taken away rather than enhanced. It also makes the metrics like contribution very hard to assess, so I feel neither of us can receive valuable feedback.

For these reasons, I think I would rather not work with you again, at least not without some extra third party guidance."

You focused more on being right, having your beliefs be heard no matter the cost rather than negotiating, respecting and understanding my learning styles, goals and process and moving our team forward so we could accomplish project goals. From the short amount of time, we 'worked' together, I noticed that you had difficulty working with someone who was different from yourself. You were ok when I sat and listened to your opinions or 'teach me', give me advice even though it was not asked for. Some of the ways you expressed your beliefs, steam rolled mine, and postured a power dynamic is clearly derived from misogyny. Your opinions, ways of thinking and behaving are not better than mine because they make more sense to you. I encourage you to read the article below to see how much you have benefitted from your male privilege and how this plays into your beliefs and actions, especially around women of color and queer people.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/02/160-examples-of-male-privilege/

Because of this, I found it extremely difficult to work with you and never felt that you cared about team process except for when we had a mediated conversation with Needra. After which, we were able to sit down to work together until you had a disagreement with me about how to get my GitHub repo on to your machine. You insisted on me giving you my username even though it is perfectly accessible via a link.

Throughout the week, I put a lot of emotional and mental effort working on team process, negotiating, coming to a solution with our communication and team dynamics with you, however, that was never reciprocated on your part. You prioritized helping other learners rather than getting work done in our team. I was the only one that kept trying to resolve problems in our communication and team dynamics. 

In the future, it would help a lot if you listened to your team mate, prioritized team work, and set aside ego even if you and your team mate have very different world views, ways of doing things, and ways of thinking. 

I never felt like you cared about team process, dynamics, and working with someone with differing view points."

Even though we had a difficult moment with communication, you stayed with the project and continued to work towards completing out goals. If I could give you some advice for those difficult moments: When communication breaks down, be open with the feelings that you're experiencing, even if that means taking a break to figure out what you're feeling. It can be vulnerable being honest with what's going on internally, and it will help clear the air and create deeper trust between you and your partner. 
I would want to work with you more if you spent more time leading, even if you're unsure of what you're doing. Taking the lead in building out parts of a CRUD app will really help solidify how the different parts connect together. I think you understood more than you realize, and I'd love to see that applied in working on a future project together."

I have a few pieces of feedback to give to you that I hope you will find to be helpful and actionable for your future pairs: 1, When we were pairing, I noticed that you would get really excited about finding the solution to the problem and you usually would come to the solution faster than I could catch up with what you were doing. This was problematic for my learning because I wasn't able to come to the solution on my own. In the future, it might be helpful to slow down and be really intentional about who is driving and who is navigating. 2, Whenever I had a solution, it seemed that sometimes you would lead by telling me why my solution was wrong rather than just allowing me to try it so I could visually see that it didn't work. I would have preferred to at least try my solution because it could have worked in some instances even if it was different than yours. There's a million ways to solve a problem so it's important to me to see that my solution doesn't work rather than just not trying it. In other instances, I had told you the solution and you may not have heard me and you would come to the same solution that I had told you about previously which made me feel like you weren't listening to me. So in the future, just try to be more receptive with your pair and be really invested in the learning of everyone."

I enjoyed how enthusiastic you were about algorithm in general and recursion in specific :) 
You're a very smart person and you have a good logic and way of thinking when it comes to breaking down problems which I admire, keep goin on this track and you'll do great :)
My feedback to you is to improve on the 3 things: 
1- communication: meaning try to think out loud when you're coding, it helps you're partner to stay connected with you when you're tackling a certain problem also it'll be a good practice for you when you do your job interviews. 
2- Timing in general, it didn't bother at all but it's just a feedback for you cause some people are bothered by it. 
3- Regarding technical skills, you have a really good technical skills, my only advise for you is to practice good styling it'll help a lot with your code and it'll also look good on your github when future recruiters look up your projects on your github. 
It was a pleasure working with you and I look forward to work with you again."

I think because of it we were able to brainstorm out of situations where my perspective had been paralyzed. Your problem solving and analytical skills are different from mine and I really liked that. It helped me see these problems that I have seen before in a new light and really leveled up my learning. I also really liked that you stayed completely in integrity while we worked. When you didn't finish something you committed to you acknowledged it and apologized. I would like to work with you more if you worked on your typing speed and your JS fundamentals. I feel like you would be a much better engineer if you were able to more promptly communicate what you are thinking into code.

Your enthusiasm helped move the project, along with your pro developer skills.
I would want to work with you more if I had been here more on time and able to access the idm auth server in order to set up the dev environment. There were a lot of times during the week where events took us out of flow, and I would challenge ourselves, myself included, to be cognizant of that fact and of how it affects the progress of the project. It was great working with you this week though, I really appreciated being able to get as much work done as we did, and even more so your patience and willingness to try out the different ideas and methods that I wanted to try out with the code.
