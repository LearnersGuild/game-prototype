I think my general work style is a bit different from yours, and we managed to find a happy medium.  I could learn a lot from the planning that you do before writing any code.

Your technical skills are awesome and I enjoyed getting to learn from you.

There were a few times where you lost focus and took a moment to get back on task, but it was never a big issue.

The main thing I would ask is for you to continue to improve on your ability to verbalize what you're thinking as you plan and make changes to the code.  (Noting of course that this is feedback you are already integrating)."

I can't think of much to say here that I haven't said in person. You've hit the point in your technical confidence where you're really starting to thrive as a developer—and joking around all week helped keep me engaged in the project despite the weird, manic energy of inauguration week. And it was super enjoyable to be able to work at a faster pace than usual (aside from those pesky regexes).

I'd want to work with you more if you continued to develop your confidence in those technical skills. I am 100% confident that you're at the point where you can MAJORLY snowball your learning by getting a little more into thoroughly perusing source/docs instead of defaulting to looking at guides and tutorials."

I loved our brain storming session. One suggestion I would like to make is just when you're not feeling 100 percent it may be a good practice to step a way from the project for a bit. There was a couple of times when tension interfered with flow and made communication difficult. When that wasn't a factor I think our focus and engagement was great and I hope to get a chance to work with you again.

Our communication agreement was upheld and we both seemed to have the same work preferences and that made things significantly easy. I think we both gave each other enough space for learning and reached out for help when we couldn't get any further with our project. You were vocal about your needs and I encourage you to continue speaking up about your needs in a team and to have tough conversations. I think the both of us could work on defining what contribution is and improve on having conversations about how we quantify our definitions of contribution. 

The only feedback I have for you is the same I have for myself, which is to be willing to be more flexible. We happened to prefer the same neat work style which worked fantastic for us, but I could see and have seen how the 'small details' that we get hung up on can get in the way of the learning process for someone else. I think the both of us got very lucky to be paired this week and I would be very happy to work with you again. Keep up the great work here."

You are in team/very engaged , and results driven which adds to the overall positive experience. We also share the common philosophy of make it work then make it work better which is wonderful and makes it a joy to work with you. I truly look forward to working with you on future projects.

I would want to work with you more if you can be more open to feedback/ideas from your team mate in overly frustrating situations. This only became an issue once (the last 30 minutes of Friday) and I feel there is a lot both of us can learn from that experience.  You were in the right to really push and find assistance to get that update route to work on our project (even with coach que being broken!) and I do appreciate that, however there were some ideas I had been looking at that we did not try or discuss. This overall issue however was also my fault as I was kind of tired by that point and did not properly communicate that ""hey I have this idea on my screen and maybe it could solve our problem"". I guess what I am trying to say is it would have been nice to discuss ideas further in that situation before seeking help, but it was Friday and I could understand the drive to ship code and make it work."

I feel like we were overall too focused on time management and we did not ""get started"". Personally, I operate best in a more flexible environment, I felt like we asked for help or used tutorials too often and for the first few days i felt like we didnt ""create"" our own code. I realize we learn very differently, and there is no right way to learn as that is based on the individual level. I learn in a more break it and fix it type of way and you like a little more structured  environment. My advice is keep learning in your own way,  but it may be best to divide and conquer with such different learning styles in the future."

I appreciated your passion and intention to learn about the project over shipping code, except the latter was the default rather than our shared agreement.  On Tuesday, and daily throughout the week, agreeing on project specs and follow through on our project management and shared agreements where rewritten every morning, without sufficient communication, nor explicit consent. My pleas to talk were unheard and often ignored throughout the week. I was extremely frustrated and challenged to be in relationship and collaborate with you because you were mostly interested in working on your own and not in team.  Project managing, and contributing to the project, and giving you support was extremely challenging: and eventually our negotiations at the standup times we agreed to, but never attended by both of my partners deteriorated our communications.  For me, it would escalate from starting as a polite ask, to resulting to the need for a facilitator when you both blatantly ignored my asks.  It was like “wrangling cats” to approach y’all and even tougher working together, because you preferred to spend more time as individuals, or focus studying (without the spiking):  which to me are not the best examples of collaborative pair programming.  In the end, I learned quite a bit about the frameworks and tutorials I suggested and we eventually used to try to build the bookstore in 3.5 days last week, and having to pivot every day.  But because you had expressed that our shared agreements and the goal to ship was not a priority over deep learning of every part of the process and code structure as we went, our shared agreements to were out of sync.  Also, it was a little strange not wanting to have coaching sessions when that’s what our game-moderators set up for our benefit. I would like to work with you in the future if you would reference and put into practice Shereef’s project contribution goal descriptions during a few more projects. I have shared these with you in our echo channel, and you can also find them in our playbook. I love you guys as passionate peers.  I am open working together or meeting in the future to figure out ways to work better together."

I appreciated your passion and intention to learn about the project over shipping code, except the latter was the default rather than our shared agreement.  On Tuesday, and daily throughout the week, agreeing on project specs and follow through on our project management and shared agreements where rewritten every morning, without sufficient communication, nor explicit consent. My pleas to talk were unheard and often ignored throughout the week. I was extremely frustrated and challenged to be in relationship and collaborate with you because you were mostly interested in working on your own and not in team.  Project managing, and contributing to the project, and giving you support was extremely challenging: and eventually our negotiations at the standup times we agreed to, but never attended by both of my partners deteriorated our communications.  For me, it would escalate from starting as a polite ask, to resulting to the need for a facilitator when you both blatantly ignored my asks.  It was like “wrangling cats” to approach y’all and even tougher working together, because you preferred to spend more time as individuals, or focus studying (without the spiking):  which to me are not the best examples of collaborative pair programming.  In the end, I learned quite a bit about the frameworks and tutorials I suggested and we eventually used to try to build the bookstore in 3.5 days last week, and having to pivot every day.  But because you had expressed that our shared agreements and the goal to ship was not a priority over deep learning of every part of the process and code structure as we went, our shared agreements to were out of sync.  Also, it was a little strange not wanting to have coaching sessions when that’s what our game-moderators set up for our benefit. I would like to work with you in the future if you would reference and put into practice Shereef’s project contribution goal descriptions during a few more projects. I have shared these with you in our echo channel, and you can also find them in our playbook. I love you guys as passionate peers.  I am open working together or meeting in the future to figure out ways to work better together."

I also enjoyed being able to observe your problem solving skills cause it allowed me to see the holes in my knowledge. I want to say thanks too for taking the lead this week on most of the actual coding. Im still a little intimidated by actually ripping apart code that isn't mine in such a huge code base so it felt good to be on the sidelines so that next week I am able to understand how to go about charging into a big project. Super stoked that out Favicon issue got merged into the the deployed site, I have something more to brag about. Aside from the work I appreciate that you are easy to work with and are able to take breaks and goof off to make the work environment fun to be in.

You were open to learning more about a subject you'd explored in the past. I enjoyed approaching the project form a new angle with new eyes. My goal was to deepen both my excitement and knowledge of core algorithms and testing. My goals were exceeded pair with you. Thank you! I'd like to pair with you more because you are an excellent pair partner and coach. Based on the way you demonstrated your knowledge and paired I'd hire you / recommend you for a position. I don't have any deltas to surface regarding our pair. My deltas this are about the game mechanics / LOS. We were negatively impacted by the inconsistencies. Also, felt distracted and deflated by the overall drama and tension in the space. The guest speaker from SFMTA using affirmative action (equal opportunity) and felony in the same sentence following the diversity talk resulted in a full stop energetically. Although it was difficult for both of us we pulled through and narrowed in on what was important to us. Thank you for your support!"

I got a little off task here and there and took quite a few breaks but you seemed to genuinely not be bothered by this, and just switched tasks readily. You were distracted at some points but acknowledged. In the end we grinded through some really tough problems smoothly. 

I felt difficulty at communicating some of my knowledge on particular object / structures and big-picture concepts but you didn't get easily frustrated by it, and kept in team with me while we figured out what we were both thinking.

You allowed for structure as we discussed how to approach problems, with the goal of approaching them more scientifically, I didn't quite do this for part: lack of understanding, and part: being a little ""rushy"" but this didn't seem to bother you too much.

I like the excitement you had whenever we would surpass a problem or think of another way of going about things. I also appreciated that you could laugh and joke about the more infuriating points of sequelize, which helps keep things from getting too tense."
