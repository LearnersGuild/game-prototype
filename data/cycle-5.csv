I feel like since this was such an individual project that I did not get to experience you as a coder at 100% or get as much interaction as I wanted with you. 

I want to work with you b/c you flow like water, have no projected judgements about people, are very nice to interact with and if I was on an intensive coding project that we would work very well together.

I would like to work more with you if you tried to include team mates a bit more, co working together was nice. However we did not have enough of it this week and part of that was because we did not have a compromise in our environment, which I wish we would have discussed more in hindsight. ie I like light side, you like dark side :)"

I appreciate you letting me give you feedback and in turn giving me constant feedback and making me rethink how I thought about a lot of things. 

I want to work with you b/c I learn so much in terms of how to overcome my own feedback validations, how I value myself, what I let affect me and what leads to becoming a stronger emotionally and mentally person.

I would want to work with you more if you:
-allowed other trains of thought that may differ from your own
-were kinder in your feedback to people
-remembered your feedback and gave it after a discussion
-were able to follow discussions from people that may not be relevant to the discussion at hand
-put aside the differences you see in people an learned to still allow for free minded discourse 
-tried to unlearn your own biases towards me and how you valued me as a person
-any time I give you feedback I would prefer to not feel like whatever I said was not actually taken in and was just thrown back on me in a negative format. 
-analyzed why you did not trust me to perform certain actions however automatically believed that others you had not dealt with were able to perform those actions (ie lead a fun team, esp since I did not even want to lead a fun activity team lol) 

However I personally still know that I can do that if I wanted too based on my personal experience and I do not need to prove it to you."
