NOTE: I worry this feedback is going to be another instance of conflicting feedback. I can see how it would conflict with the ""be more aggressive"" feedback I gave your last time we worked together. If you feel this way, I would love and oportunity to talk.


I would want to work with you again more if we could figure out how to balance getting (what we each need) with (having a smooth pairing experience). I think this is in part the tension between being ourself and being in relationship. Sometimes I feel, or see your pair feeling, pulled away from flow. I'm not saying this is anyones fault. Pairing is a team sport. But it looks like its costing a lot of time and energy so I hope we can find a way to smooth pairing out for you."

Youâ€™re a very easy going person and are open to new ideas and methods of working which is great and refreshing, yet you were also able to stand by your ideas on how to move forward which is great.
