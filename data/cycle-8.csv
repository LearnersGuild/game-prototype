I would like working with you more if you spent more time helping others level up. Being a good pair even when your pair is slowing you down is a skill you want to have. 

Check in with yourself when you're getting frustrated and try to find ways to accept that you need to support the learning of others. If you can become a rockstart at helping your team mates you'll be a much more capable and hirable programmer.

You are also able to properly talk about what you are thinking and would prefer the next move to be for going forward with the project. It was great to work with you because you are very easy going, and were able to persevere through the moments of frustration. I would want to work with you more if we would have been able to set some more appropriate specs. Also, I got the sense that you were distracted at times, which is definitely understandable and I am also a victim of it. It was definitely great working with you though, no doubt."

You're crushing it in terms of both cultural contribution and team play from what I can see. 

As for your ability to contribute I don't have the best feedback because I feel like we cogapp a lot and I don't get a clear view into what you do/dont understand or can/can't do. 

I'd like working with you more if you were more willing to drive and expose your ignorance.

Thanks for all your help mediating this week."

I would like working with you more if you were a bit more focused at times. You're excitement to do things other than program is appreciated but does sometimes imply a lack of taking things seriously. I'm sure you are taking this program seriously but you should be aware that sometimes i see people questioning that. 

Keep working hard and showing off your skills. I can tell you're picking up JS really well. Keep it up"
