I’d want to work with you more if . . . there was just the once instance (which we already discussed) in which  there was a longer stretch of you helping other groups followed by a long-ish ice-cream break. So in the future, I’d ask that you set up clear timeframes for such things with your team, and prioritize moving the project forward. This is a minor issue compared to all the positives listed above."
