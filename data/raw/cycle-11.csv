I enjoy working with you because your technical knowledge is at a level where I can be supported by your understanding of the code. I appreciate that you've been self aware of how what you do affects culture/others, and I appreciate you acknowledging when I do things well. That makes me feel more comfortable on a team and confident enough to take risks so that we can continue to keep working. I felt that you managed your time well. 

I would want to work with you more if you continued to deepen into the culture. I don't have anything specific, but I've seen improvement since the first time we've worked together and I feel much more comfortable working with you. Basically, keep doing whatever you're doing."

You told me what you were thinking in a way that, I got to participate in the problem solving by taking a lead from you, by mimicking your way of thinking and sharing my own suggestions on how to solve the problem. It was also very very good to see your process of researching, implementing,  failing, isolating the fail and considering another theory.  You also were able to understand my block with some of the tutorials/books/online resources and how I felt excluded from the ability to learn js because of how these resources are written in academic text. You were able to bridge/code switch and only because of that, did I have success with creating functions! Thank you so much!

I want to work with you because:
I appreciate the consistent move forward that you bring to the table. It is a little reminder for me to get ""the rest"" done instead of trying to perfect and/or explain the ""current task"" that I or we were working/stuck on. You could even say it's almost like a simple competition, not that I want to win, but more that I don't want to fall too far behind on task completion.

I would want to work with you more if:
You take a moment to figure out more ""how"" the code works, vs. just that it does not create an error."

You also challenged yourself and others and sought out growth for yourself and helped everyone extend their potential. Your focus, dedication and motivation supported our team in staying on task as well as focused on the best outcomes for the team. I would want to work with you more if you stepped into leadership roles when needed, and supported others to step into leading roles. I really enjoyed working with you and thought that I was able to learn a lot working with you while accomplishing a lot of the work that need to be done. I just think that you were withholding your input at certain times and I would like to be able to have a clearer understanding of what your thought processes are. I'm also working on a lot of this as well, and overall it was a great experience."

Aside from that one incident on Thursday that we already cleared, I felt like we communicated well and had a great team dynamic as a whole, and when we had difficulties I very much appreciated the way we cleared with each other after taking a step back. I would want to work with you more if you didn't share my weakness of pushing ourselves to a crashing point, and if you were a little more comfortable working in a different coding paradigm than you're used to, but I also totally understand when something like that can feel overwhelming. You're also very expressive of your current emotional state, which can be a huge strength, but when we all crashed at once on Thursday, feeling your frustration along with you was overwhelming. All I wanted to do was make you feel better, which made it a little more difficult to communicate on a purely technical level."
