And not just code wise but also culturally, your attention to the space we shared as a big team of 3 smaller teams was great. Your technical skills came into play more than you were giving yourself credit for as well. You helped us work through the problems we got stuck on and you helped make sure our code was clean and easy to read, instilling good code-readability practices. I think you made an excellent team lead for the blackjack-crew."

Am happy we got a chance to work with each other, you were also invested in the project and that helped me a lot to be on the same level of commitment when I was having problems outside the guild that got in my way of learning but you pulled me in and am thankful for it. 
I would LOVE to work with you again in the future because of all of what I've I mentioned above but also because it's just fun working with you and to me that's one of the major goals in life, is not to only work, achieve and build things but to also have fun along the process and what's better than bringing fun people on board to have a great fun journey.

The level of comfort we had, allowed us to effectively deal with every challenge, technical and emotional that came up. I loved working with you and look forward to any future projects we might be on.

I would want to work with you more if you had better typing and syntax skills. You progressed a lot even during just our week together, so you are already totally on track. After hearing about the surgeon apprenticeship model idea, I was thinking that a way to handle when you feel someone is moving to fast to track, is to note to yourself that you are feeling lost and just watch for a bit so that the train of thought is not interrupted, then step in and ask questions. Or maybe, if it feels not constructive at all to continue watching, that could be a good time for a chunk of time of individual time."

I would want to work with you more if you took things a bit more seriously.  Also, it seems to me that sometimes you don't respect other's personal space enough.  Sometimes you take over someone else's keyboard or mouse without asking and sometimes you put your hand in front of the screen blocking other people's view.  It also seems like sometimes you don't think enough before asking a question in order to ask a clear question."

You took my jokes lightly and you didn't take them personally. Thank you. You also shared with the team your views and desires strongly and directly. Throughout the week it became clearer that you were becoming more patient with my differences and me asking many questions. I really appreciate you doing that. I really enjoyed your hard work and your desire to kill the bugs in our code. That type of energy makes it really enjoyable to learn from you. Those are only a few reasons why I enjoy working with you.

I would want to work with you more if you continue to improve on being patient with different points of view. At one time, I felt you become frustrated at my possible solution. You later apologized. I appreciate you taking the extra step."

You claim to be new, and I don't doubt that, but the skills you bring, from whereever that may be, they must be significant because you're capacity for understanding and learning logical patterns is exquisite. You learn fast, retain a lot, and continue to find ways to share even in areas you don't know yet. I would want to work with you more if you keep being yourself. As discussed, don't be afraid to be confident in what you know and let others know. At the same time, don't sacrifice that wonderful calm demeanor you have that makes others feel cozy, but not lazy. This suggestion, however, does not affect my wanting to work with you. Know that even if you completely ignored it I'd still love to work with you, so you should personally weigh whether or not it will help you grow. It's possible it's bad advice, and your calmness would be diminished if you asserted yourself more. Only you can decide if that's something you should try."

We finally got to do a project together!  So stoked that we got this opportunity and looking forward to the next one .  I really appreciated your last minute askingof  the right question, and also the way you modeled being a good learner.  You really approached the whole thing, as you do everything from what I've observed, with an inspiring humility and curiosity. It was so evident in that moment because you obviously didnt have the same familiarity with the code that the three of us did, but you still managed to come up with the right question, and then you ""showed your work"" and broke down how you got there.  I feel like one thing I'll definitely take away from this week is the idea that when you're dealing with multiple code bases you really have to look at things as discrete chunks of code rather than trying to understand the whole immediately. One thing, that I think you kind of learned towards the end of the week,  which I think might help your culture and contribution scores is that as an 'advanced player' I think our focus should be on helping the person with the least technical skill and relieving some of that burden from the more technically skilled people on the team.  I saw you kind of pairing and cog-apping on Friday morning, and I would just encourage you to do that earlier in the game.  In particular, in retrospect I got the feeling (because they're right next door to me) that Isis, and Mo were kind of on the same wavelength  but that Robert might have needed more support.    I think it might have benefited everyone for you to have honed in on that early and spent some time pairing with him and helping him get to the level that his teammates were at."

You kept the whole group cracking up through a good part of the week, which was awesome. You're a joy to work with, and your questions were pivotal in my deepening of my existing JS knowledge, which is just as important as learning entirely new things. I would want to work with you more if you were less hard on yourself. You're a classic perfectionist, and you direct way more pressure and negativity towards yourself than you will ever deserve, even if it's totally outweighed by the outward positivity. Learn to be comfortable with not knowing things, and learn to be confident in your ability to find them out, and I truly believe you will be able to become a brilliant developer!"

You were very engaging throughout the entire project. You didn't give up in the face of stress/brick walls/etc. You tend to be able to look at those ""walls"" from a different angle, which allowed our team to solve problems from a different perspective.

I would want to work with you more if:
You didn't hide your true self. Don't be afraid to let the real you shine through.
Be a little more vocal, and don't be afraid to have your comments be heard, because they are usually good comments that NEED to be heard."

You kept the team focused on what needed to be accomplished each day to ensure our success. Your easy going demeanor helped the team stay relaxed, which I believe helped us solve problems more readily then if there was a lot of tension. Your knowledge of Express, PostgreSQL, and Javascript and your willingness to take time to explain concepts when I did not understand them helped advanced my knowledge and I appreciate this. You also were honest in what you knew and what you did not know. Thank you. I would want to work with you again anytime, the only thing I could say is that I would want you to let your teammates know in advance if you are not going to be there (I do not know if this was possible due to the business you had to take care of)."

Your unwavering energy (even with a migraine!) is infectious and helped me during my own energy slumps. I appreciate your teaching skills because you are absolutely confident when you explain how a function works and why you implemented certain logic. With that said, I would want to work with you more if you checked in more frequently with the group (definitely hard to balance when one is in more than one group). Please do more structured scheduling where you update your team with any news, changes, issues, etc. I appreciated the check-ins in the morning but I'd also say to maybe use a timer as done in home group. I have time and distraction issues, too and I want to thank you for being a great advanced player on our team. You've got a very good balance of technical and cultural engagement here."

We're all learning the best way to learn and to work with other people so I think you're doing better at both than you give yourself credit for.

I'd ask that you aren't as self-deprecating in the future because it's more distracting than it is endearing.

I appreciate that you were transparent with us in sharing that you are dealing with personal challenges, and that that will affect your patience and willingness to pair. I would want to work with more you in the future if you were more careful around your treatment of your teammate. Your decision to tell TJ that you would never work with him again had a very big impact on our team, and
I know that you said later that you were not serious, but there was no way for us to know that, and those words had a big impact.

On the bigger picture, my feedback would be that your decision to prioritize your contribution higher than the health, culture, and safety of our team had major consequences, and I would ask that you be very careful with that in the future."

I would want to work with you more if you find that balance in letting people have autonomy, and freedom, but not sacrafice structure. The circumstances of being in two teams stretched interpretation of this scenario thin, so weigh this advice with a grain of salt. In a situation when people say ""We're good, we're okay, we got it"" perhaps give them the space those statements imply, but find some way to stay engaged regardless. How? I'm not sure. But when you DO discover the answer to this, you'll be amongst the greats when it comes to leadership. I wish I could have programmed with you to have a better read of your technical skills and comment on your software development. Perhaps take it upon yourself to make more hard-coded rules on time-management so you can fit those slots in.

I feel like this statement loses potency because of how many times myself and others have said it, but I want to assure you it's being said because of a reason. You glow. In a non-measurable way. When you are confident in yourself and you are creating functions or something that gets you excited, your excitement bleeds onto me and I become excited. You also have a thirst for knowledge, and underneath that super-ego of yours is all the materials for creating a perfect learning machine. I would want to work with you more if you build your self confidence, or perhaps self-consoling. Be less hard on yourself. You're already making the steps you need to be taking. Your personality won't fall into laziness if you let go a little. Since I get the feeling you my already know this, perhaps my advice is: find a way to turn that knowledge into action. People aren't telling you to be less hard on you JUST to reassure you. There are other ways to reassure somebody. They're choosing those specific words because it's true. You are good. You are where you need to be. Just keep practicing, and find that oh so difficult to practice skill of ""patience"""

They acted in integrity. They helped to create and maintain clear accountabilities. They stood firm in their domain and power, and respected the domains of others.  They helped explain everything to the detail.

I would like to work more with you if you can create balance between taking the support role and also taking care of yourself.  Don't slow the project down for the sake of others, and don't take the role or responsibility of making sure that everyone is satisfied."
