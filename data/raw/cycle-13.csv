I'd want to work with you more if you had a more solid understanding of how the web works and how the JavaScript language works. I felt at times crippled in our ability to work together by not being able to move as quickly as we could if you had a better understanding of what was going on. But it's only week 3!

In many conversations, you seem excited and tend to talk a lot about your ideas. I don't want you to diminish your excitement, but I would like it if you paused to let others speak first at times."

I want to work with you because:
You have a really good grasp on using different modules and applying different methods within javascript.
You also believe in very consistent code that looks well and have a process model that ensures the ability to know what happened and how it happened throughout the project.

I would want to work with you more if:
You spent (or had more) time to spend explaining how you were able to decipher a code example. Or, in essence, breakdown why you chose a particular module. (hope this makes sense)."

I have a lot of appreciation for how focused you are. There tends to be one person on a team that puts the most into keeping everything and everyone organized, and you're definitely that. I would want to work with you more if you continued improving your technical skills. I see so much more confidence from you with regards to your soft skills than your technical skills, and perceive that your positive attributes that make you a natural leader in other ways might also contribute to a lack of comfort with ambiguity in general. If you develop that comfort, it will serve you well in becoming a fantastic engineer."

You're also willing to do a lot of ""extra"" work and tasks to help things go along smoothly. 

I would like to work with you more if i felt like you were challenging yourself more. You seem to take tasks that are a little too easy for you. My guess is you're staying below a 5 or 6 in your ZPD and I'd love to see you struggling more around 7. 

my sense is you're more capable than you give yourself credit for. You'll get more from LG if you push yourself."

I now know the actual names for the parts and concepts of programming that have been nameless to me. I just hope, as an advanced player, you get more chances to push yourself as well. I could be wrong, but I got the impression that this week you spent more time being a teacher than a student.

Communication was better this week.  Knowing when we had you and for how long was definitely good, though I feel like those time blocks became a lot more fuzzy as the week went on.  (I'm sure missing huge blocks of time for home group and all the stress with your mother were a factor.  We were all pretty brain fried by Thursday).  
As we mentioned before, you could be better at explaining things, but that has definitely improved from last week.  I encourage you to let people drive more.  It helps the driver learn what's going on better, and gives you a lot of practice at explaining what's going on."

You've totally got the being yourself side of the Belonging tension down. My feedback is to work on the being together side. 

Another value you could work on is the Flexible Leadership part of team play. 

Another thing I noticed is you seemed super tired this week. Maybe you're having trouble sleeping? Being rested is crucial to learning. I hope you can find a way to get the rest you need to bring your full self to LG"

It’s been such a treat to absorb so much of your git knowledge.  So I think I finally have some constructive criticism for you. Two sides of the same coin: on one hand, I continue to admire the way in which you speak your truth, seemingly fearlessly, and give others genuine feedback. In giving feedback, one holds the trust tension between truth and safety. And I think that there are instances in which some of your feedback might have the unintended consequence of making an individual feel unwanted, disliked, or not part of the group. I’m thinking about a few instances, one was your feedback on the posture of Jason, which might be a pretty personal / sensitive thing. I can’t speak to the experiences of our groupmates, and honestly, I think that our groupmates received your feedback very well. And, I want you to be aware of this tension, because I imagine that there will be instances in the future in which you’ll be giving constructive criticism to a team member who is not such a jedi at receiving feedback, and they’ll experience a super-ego attack and become disproportionately defensive and angry. So my suggestion: keep speaking your truth, and keep reading your audience so you are aware of potential barriers to an individual receiving the feedback you’re giving. <3"

While we didn't finish the project. I received a lot more clarity from how hard we worked. You didn't want an easy way out and that is a lot fun. 

I would want to work with you more if you recognize when its time to ask for help. At LG, we have the privilege to learn faster and better solutions from experienced professionals. I hope you choose to lean on them just a little more."
