You understand the arbitrary concepts laid out in code examples on websites almost no matter how little code exists there.

Also, knowing vocabulary/terminology about the topic at hand helps to eliminate confusion during conversation."

Your engagement and curiosity to learn why certain aspects of our projects were working the way that they did was refreshing because I also like to explore. I felt that I could be myself and you made it easy to belong in the group. I also appreciated the way you realized when you needed time to rest or reflect, as I sometimes do not realize this for my self, so you reminded me on a daily basis. If I have any suggestions for future group work, it would involve trying to temper goal setting in terms of the amount of work you may want to finish. I loved the elevator game idea, but I think that may take a whole week to complete."

Please also consider on other ways to improve your focus (and this is as much to myself as well). Find tools that will continue to support yourself and the team as far as breaking down tasks. You've got great project manager-type skills and big picture thinking that is an asset. Keep using the white board!!

It was difficult to work with you this week because of our communication. There was something about pairing that got in the way of our flow and took time away from us accomplishing tasks. It was difficult to see your process in planning and although I know you had the capability to accomplish our tasks I felt it was difficult for me to see you wanting to work within our teams established norms for contributing. For example, staying within the scope of our tickets, challenging the way we contribute. I think criticism is healthy, but at some point we need to balance getting the project done. I also challenge you to self-asses to accurately give your team members an idea of how long you think it would take you to complete tasks. For example, you said you thought client and server validation would be done by Monday. If it isn't, and it ended up being a more difficult problem, or because of the existing code base...that is fine. I just wish you had been more upfront and acknowledge that so you and your team member could be on the same page."

Since day one we had a great start and we were on the same page through out the whole project, I really appreciate you took a chance at the beginning to work with me on what we setup to be a stretch goal with the object oriented even though you've done it before. 
I want to work with you more cause you're technical skill level is really good but also you're very supportive and open to new ideas and always willing to try new things which I admire and most important to me we had fun working on the project, it was just the perfect amount of productive yet chilled and not stressful to keep a clear head and allow the stream of thoughts to follow. 
Keep doing what you're doing now and you'll be an amazing programmer. 
Best of luck in everything and looking forward to work with you more."
