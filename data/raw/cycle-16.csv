I appreciate your methodical approach to problem solving. I also paid more attention to the specifications and project preparation while either you or I were reading it aloud. You took breaks at times when you were frustrated or could not find a solution to the problem which reminded me to do the same. I felt that you were somewhat frustrated by the lack of actual tutorial material in one place, as it would be in a book, but I felt that you overcame that frustration by gathering different resources with me and then determining the quality of each. Your team play was commendable. I felt fully vested into our group and our goal and I felt that you provided for the full exercise of my agency. I would like to work with you again."

If there is some reason you didn't or couldn't ask me for help please let me know.

- CSS styling
- CSS animations

We obviously have a lot to talk about and get along well on a personal level, but if I expected that the level of effort you put in this week was the norm rather than an exception I wouldn't want to work with you again.  To be honest, I feel like I kind of coasted this week, and I feel your energy level was a big part of that.  After the week I had with Nico last week I was hoping to build on that momentum and it felt like just the opposite happened. I want to do big things, and I want to have fun while doing them but in order to do that we have to push each other on the weeks that we want to slack off.

My sense is the work this week pushed you beyond your ZPD. Either that or you didn't push yourself hard enough. What do you think? I'd like to talk to you about this more for clarity.

I'd would want to work with you more if you:
- were on time every day without excuses
- were working with your team members near the Trossello cave
- asked for more help sooner when you need it

I'd really like to give you feedback on the skills I think you need to work on but I didn't get enough of a view of you this week. How can we help me get this exposure in the future?"""

I have a slight ambivalence about the issue of unclear communication as brought up this morning: on one hand, I totally believe in that ""jump right in the deep end"" philosophy, and that's where I'm happiest from a technical/flow standpoint. On the other hand, the more explicit the communication, the fewer spoons it takes me to process it, and I have to manage my spoons pretty carefully. And I recognize that not everyone is able to stay down in their ZPD by jumping in the deep end.

So in the end I personally feel like it's a good thing, and contributes to putting Trossello at somewhat of a higher difficulty level than Floworky.

I'd want to work with you more if you put a little more effort into clarifying the issues and desired features for Trossello, but take that with the caveat that all the cross-group collaboration is the particular thing that got me into my ZPD."

I had so much fun working with you this week. My only hopefully constructive feedback is that you should try and work on is focusing and also clarity. Focus, of course we can both work on and I appreciated your help in keeping me on track and bearing with me through the times I had to deal with my other responsibilities outside of the guild. The clarity piece is that you have awesome ideas and sometimes I feel that you're going so quickly through everything that I feel kind of lost. I had a lot of fun overall writing ""Jargonscript"" with you. :)"

You have a clear idea of what you're trying to accomplish or how to think things through but sometimes I was having a hard time understanding your ideas and that's because sometimes you take long pauses when you communicate your ideas and I get lost or sometimes don't even finish your explanation but once you master that you'll be unstoppable. Best of luck with everything and I hope I get to work with you again in the near future.."

I also appreciate the time that you spend guiding us along the correct path, but also the space to explore how can we get the feature implemented. I would want to work with you more if I knew how to properly use git and not create the awful conflicts.
I also appreciated how you were able to keep track of so many tasks and the order in which features are merged, and so I would just suggest using either the echo or trello for more concrete communication between team members and yourself in order to keep better track of the progress and any changes that need to occur, specially between teams. That is more of a suggestion for the overall team structure, even though it was also due to my miscommunication as well. It was so great working on Trossello again and am enjoying learning so much more, thanks for all of your help."

Thank you for the effort you put into this team while you struggled through your grief and loss—I know that it took a lot of effort to make it in, and I was impressed at how you showed up and contributed throughout all of that. 

I really appreciated how you and I framed the week, shared our learning styles, and requests of each other. It was helpful for when we were working together, and also awesome to see that model so I can use it in future teams. Awesome intentionality, and cool that you took notes on what we shared.

I experienced a physical inner tension during points when we disagreed on how to proceed. I don’t have much clarity on the potential reasons for this; wondering if it’s related to having been on a previous group in which you and Syd had major conflict (and my own aversion to conflict), or if it’s related to knowing that you’re going through major grieving, and me being concerned about conflict while you’re dealing with that.
Not a big thing, just wanted to name it, and I’m happy to chat about it if it’s helpful.

You're an excellent developer, a big contributor to our culture, and I look forward to working with you in the future."

I would be able to pair with you more effectively if you explained your thinking a little more clearly because at times I felt that you understood something a little more clearly than I did and so I was quite clear about what your thoughts were as we worked through the problem.

I loved your ability to quickly notice when we were not on the same page and stop disparate unproductive thought trajectories from gaining too much traction. I appreciated when you did a check in when you felt something was off and we figured it out. There were a few times when you slowed down to explain things to me and slowed down the process. Give some extra attention to making a point of going at the speed that puts you into your zpd, even when others are not able to keep up. Overall, I think our work flow was the most productive and the best learning experience I've had yet. Thank you for being awesome and smart and kind :D"

I would however have liked to see you and James take on more work once I took over drag and drop.

I also never really got a chance to see your work on labels. I would have liked to help you with that more than I did. Do you thik you could ask for more help sooner or was I not available enough?

Given the task you worked on I would recommend you focus on the following skills:
- git rebasing 
- sql joins
- parallel sql updates
- React basics

I'm happy to have your work on these skills on Trossello. You're welcome to come back anytime :)"

I want to work with you because of the incredible amount of growth that's happened on both sides. I think it's true that our similarity has that mirror effect, and while it causes a LOT of tension sometimes, I've always come away from reflecting or seeking feedback on those tensions feeling like I have a lot more insight in how to just plain get better. So when I get away from my triggered lizard brain, I'm perfectly happy dealing with those tensions in the moment, because I know it means that I'm about to level up.

I'd want to work with you more if we were collectively better equipped to step out of those moments of friction before they affect us too deeply, but take that with a grain of salt, because I still recognize that every time it happens we get closer to that point. :)"
