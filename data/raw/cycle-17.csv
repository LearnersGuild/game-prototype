I  appreciate your desire to deeply understand all the complexities of code and to follow the highest standards. It shows your commitment to becoming a viable engineer in the industry and your commitment to contributing to the success of the learners to come. I think it would benefit you to trust in the ""process of cognitive apprenticeship and that some things are learned layer by layer as opposed to seeing a concept for a week and understanding how the whole thing works by the end of the week. That's very difficult for anyone to do -  to let go of what has worked for me in the past and trust that with the pro learners, cognitive apprenticeship, your own efforts in gathering information and practice over a long period of time will pull the pieces together. I also think we all need to bring up the feelings about the new group coming in and define our roles in their learning and talk about ""not knowing"" how to do things that they may need help with to get done. We aren't their teachers. I really appreciate your work style and look forward to  working with you again."

They supported our team culture to be free from standards, judgements, and personal attacks.

I would love to work more with you if you stay engaged at all times regardless if your driving or not contributing much.  My first ten weeks consisted of a lot of cognitive app and i did not contribute much.  You can choose to drive only if you can move the project forward.  Don't assume you know things and you have to be honest with your teammate and be comfortable exposing your ignorance or else you wont be able to move forward.

It's been very interesting to see how Floworky as a project has adapted to the realities of having so many newbie devs working on it, and you have so much to teach me with regards to the specific (mostly soft) skills that I need to learn.

I'd want to work with you more if you didn't seem so overwhelmed with your time commitments. I felt like the entire onus for communication was on me, and even when I tried to communicate, you weren't particularly available. That is not something that works well with my disability, which I feel like I've had next to no support with handling in this context.

I'd also want to work with you more if I felt more encouraged and supported to genuinely push myself on a technical level. I have a huge pre-existing tension/trigger around not being 'allowed' to be as effective as I can be, and I am EXHAUSTED to the point of being at a genuine personal breaking point from having such a difficult time getting up to technical ZPD and out of soft-skills panic zone."

You have an eager mind and an unerring enthusiasm. Every problem we hit, you trucked along at full speed fearlessly. I appreciate the immediate feedback you give me while I'm navigating and going through patience, and I greately appreciate your patience that you have in dealing with my attempts to formulate a precise sentence to explain a particular situation or code concept. You asked questions, and a huge part of what I was impressed by you was your ability to perform your own research around issues that are incredibly important and pertaining to our project all on your own accord. I can't offer any advice on what you should do differently. Just keep learning more, and keep being you."

I would want to work with you more if I had actually been here this week. Yet, I really do appreciate the guidance that you have provided so far as well as the resources that you have shared in order to research and learn more about the technologies and development principles that we are using. I also know that it is not easy to merge all the different PRs and to handle the different conflicts that arise, so I suppose that I should ask for more clarity in how to prepare the PRs so that they are ready to be merged and not sit in the backlog. That is something that I should work in order to make everyone's life easier in the team."

Just keep doing what you're doing. I imagine you know what areas of this week were challenging for you and you know what to work on to get better at the kind of work we did this week. 

Keep focusing on:
- HTML & CSS styling
- React Component Composition

You're always welcome on Trossello but you might consider taking a week to work on building complex, static,  HTML & CSS layouts to hone those skills sans the complexity of React."
