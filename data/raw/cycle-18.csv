You are fun and socially outgoing person to be around in groups, but I found it very distracting when you would repeatedly carry outside conversations when we were in the middle of cogap pairing, or during our spike sessions. It was challenging to stay on-pair and be accountable to the specs we agreed on early in the week.  I felt snubbed when you decided to work on your personal projects, did the blackjack project, and the bookstore project when we agreed to work on algorithm foundation focus work and spikes on Monday and again on Wednesday.  I would want to wokr with you more if you would open up to collaborating together on how we could stay accountable to our goals, and ask you to consider talk more openly about your process and needs as you keep these so close to your vest.

I want to work with you because you continue to challenge me to think of solutions for problems on my own. 

At the beginning of the week I was under the impression that lizardboard was going to be more like a real life open source project in which we do not have access to the project owner in person, solely on slack. This would have been an interesting dynamic. For the most part it was and I enjoyed working on slack only. 

I would want to work with you more if you were a bit more vocal to new peeps that joined the OSS project and shared what was expected a bit  more. 

I would also want to work with you more if I felt like my communication with you was not a burden. I felt as though I was pushing too much to try and communicate with you like I was bugging you too much at times. 

It would be cool to know if that is a story in my mind or was I bugging you when you were quite busy? -Harman"

I'd be curious to get your feedback on how this week went for you technically - I have the sense that this was outside of your technical ZPD, possibly because of the stack - my ideal is to leave OSS teams mostly to their own devices to research and come up with solutions, and I felt like there might have been a lot of support necessary for you to get this task done.  

Having said that, I enjoy seeing the technical progress you have been making over the past few months, but continue to advocate for urgency in your learning process.  Happy to chat with you to see if I can refine this messy feedback.  :)"

This has been a challenging past week and your positive attitude really helped make the week go by as smoothly as it could while we were here. I would want to work with you more if you could focus more. However, this is a hard one to rate this week since the election was combined with a short week with many time interruptions that we couldn't control, so I don't think that lack of a focus is a normal issue for you. I'd like to work with you on a project that isn't foundational.

I kinda feel like we had a some communication problems this week, but I’m having a hard time figuring exactly what they were.  I think that because we can both be really shy in similar ways, there was a shared reluctance to speak up about things.  

I think I was pretty frustrated because I could never quite communicate my knowledge gap.  We never seemed to reach understanding about the specific concepts I was missing in React and how the project was organized.  That’s certainly a matter for both of us.  On your end, I think I would suggest working on your ability to explain general concepts, and asking questions to get a better feel for where your partner stands and how they learn.

It occurs to me as I write this that maybe we should have had a conversation about learning styles.  I’m a very visual learner, and I don’t know if you are as well, and that may have had a lot to do with it.

You are good at getting a feel for how a project is put together, you’re very driven to learn, and I appreciate how you like to dive in, make small test projects, and figure things out.  I liked how excited you were for the project, even if it turned out a little too difficult in the end.  I also appreciate that you are definitely interested in what your partner has to say and finding ways to work well together, and you take feedback well."

I felt comfortable in our group and you provided me with a lot of efficacy, in terms of self-autonomy. I especially liked that you went for help from the pro players for concepts that caused you trouble. I would like to work with you more if you engaged yourself more in the project, even if the material is difficult for you. While being more engaged, you could also contribute to your own growth by asking more questions of your partner(s) and to allow the chance to figure certain problems out."

You were always positive, even when you got frustrated at being blocked. You kept going and did work when I wasn't around last week. You already know a lot, which is an asset, but you sought out more knowledge actively. You were flexible, which is a huge plus, and I never felt uncomfortable or talked over. When I asked if you wanted to try out a different path or different technology, or get help from another team or pro player, you were always down. You stayed focused when it was time to be focused but also allowed us to make multiple breaks. Would love to work with you again."

Your adaptability and flexibility helped me stay focused on what I can contribute to the team. You inspired me to work even when I felt like giving up, by taking the time to seek out help for me, and being ever mindful of how to incorperate it. I very much enjoyed how you allowed me to make a suggestion, and then even took the lead on it, specifically implementing the zen boards for organizing our work-style and how that will increase our efficiency as a team. I did find it difficult to work with your advanced technical skills, the certainty you had on completing the project was both inspiring but also intimidating. I felt very lost with some aspects, and your assuredness on being able to accomplish things left me feeling off-balance. Your commend about being against using compass, and the method you use for navigating your way through which stack to choose, had me puzzled on the reasons why. e.g. Why did we go against the flow of what others' were telling us? I had a difficult time feeling comfortable enough to ask questions because you had your own questions which you wanted resolved and you seemed to have a powerful presense or strength of will in getting those answered, thus I felt like asking questions would detract from you rather than enhance our group dynamic (I'm referring specifically to our convo with deonna). No advice to give, maybe I need to be more assertive, I'm not sure; Take with a grain of salt."
