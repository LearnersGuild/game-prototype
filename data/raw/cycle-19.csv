I enjoyed your organizational mindset and the ideas you brought to the fore on how we could go about facing the project this week. 

The one issue you brought up during this week was your difficulty learning from tutorials and your preference for visual learning and mentorship. I'd worked with you in a previous project and I know you were far less distracted then, which in retrospect made sense because we mostly cog-apped. During this project neither myself or our other partner were knowledgeable of the subject and so I know it was really challenging to stay in focus. 

If you find yourself ever losing focus in a situation similar to ours this week (where we were all new to the problem) don't be afraid to speak on it."

I liked how you did rounds and would pop in to check in on how we were doing. You always showed up when we were mini-blocked and made our workflow more efficient. I was a little sad there wasn't as much back and forth on PRs but there we alot of teams so it is understandable.

I liked that you gave your input on the project and asked ""why"" i was programming certain ways. You were fully present and fully participated in all aspects, even though we loosely designated different work (i.e. me game-logic, you front-end). I did feel pressure and over-pressed when you wanted an answer for how and why I was doing certain things. Although I appreciate your patience, I felt pressed for time to explain them; I felt rushed, i.e. like you were in a hurry to get an answer from me.

It was really enjoyable to co-discover and co-explore the complex Floworky ecosystem with you; your curiosity is good to be around, and definitely advanced the project.
I appreciate your communication style—because of the way you share your thoughts, feelings, and opinions transparently, I was able to trust and feel comfortable collaborating.  For example, I was really glad when you brought up the tension between you getting a question answered and me pushing forward in the project. Glad we were able to have such conversations.
Great working with you, and glad to share the process of you getting in-flow with the OSS projects!"

I really appreciate the passion you bring to the project, especially around getting the solution right!  I sensed a lot of frustration around the conversations, and wanted to offer the feedback that I find it perfectly acceptable (and desirable!) to disagree with an implementation, and to represent and defend your proposals.  You had stated a few times that you felt like we were butting heads, but I felt like we were having a healthy, spirited conversation around the direction of the project!  I think you will need to work on the skill, however, of being able to work with abstractions that you do not agree with - sometimes we don't have enough information to make a perfect thing the first time through, so need to be comfortable coming up with or implementing a solution that still feels ambiguous."

I really enjoyed us pairing and debugging but also we accomplished a good amount of work working individually so it was a good week and a good balance, also we have a lot of common things that I enjoyed talking to you about. 
My only feedback to you is to be more patient and recognize how time consuming it can be to debug and by recognizing that you won't be frustrated as quick"

I really appreciated your focus on team process and your willingness to have conversations about how things were going and get feedback and such.  

Your technical skills seem ok, but you seemed to have a hard time following along with stuff at times.  Of course, I know a lot of this comes from the depression and other personal issues you've been dealing with lately. I like that you were open about your strategies for dealing with your ADD (such as going off into a blank file to write functions without clutter).  In retrospect, I think maybe it would have been good if we broke out some paper or a whiteboard to diagram some stuff.

I think the main thing I would add would be to better learn when to ask for help, or just seek confirmation that you're headed down the right road.  (I'm thinking particularly about some of the git merge stuff)."

You balance all of the tensions well, and manage to address personal concerns while thinking about the pairing and the team. I would want to work with you again since you understand the dance of solo and pair programming, I also want to acknowledge our earlier conversation about the idea that you are declining in skills. I disagree, I think that we are all in a dance to figure out how to level up while we are in fact leveling up. Be confident!!!!"

Know that the first iteration of this feedback disappeared after a channel reload, so I will be trying to recreate all that I typed.

Working with you is fun because you always like to approach projects, as I do, with new ways of ""attack"" instead of using (copy/paste) old repositories.
You're not afraid to try something new.

At times though, the search for a new way or for ""cool factor"" seems to send you down a rabbit hole that can affect efficient use of time. Even when the idea is agreed to make the project ""that much cooler"", focusing on the ability to finish all specs may need to be thought about.

I had a little bit of frustration when trying to understand what you had just completed because you were already off and running on a new idea, especially when the recent changes were not originally discussed about being put in as well as the new/next idea not being communicated before starting on it."

Often when I was lacking in something you filled in the gap and we got through it together.

I think you need to assert yourself more. Maybe you are a bit too easygoing. You are very smart and you can afford to throw your weight around more than you do.

I don't think you are actualizing your full potential. There were times when it seemed like you weren't really present and you were processing things slowly. Maybe you have other things going on that are not allowing you to focus fully and apply yourself to coding. I think you need to be inspired somehow and become passionate."

You were easy to talk to, you were open to trying new methods. You were game to try our stretch project. You also inspired me to begin taking notes to add quality to our repo. I really enjoyed your sense of humor and your ease and flexibility. Please continue to be that open throughout your time here. Keep speaking up when you pair with other people. Show them your awesome personality. Express your thoughts on a project and be willing to break stuff - it's not the end of the world. Don't throw your laptop! LOL. Keep it easy and loose and keep your sense of humor. If you need to cry do that too, but, keep it loose =) I really loved that about you this week."
