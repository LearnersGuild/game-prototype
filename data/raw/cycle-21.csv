I greatly appreciate the space you gave me, allowing me to think up solutions to problems on my own so that I could learn and get better. I really value that you allowed us to learn from each other by separating first, then coming back together, then separating again. This method allowed me to learn more this week than the past 3 weeks combined. You respected my space and autonomy and this enabled me to have a much richer experience. In areas that we disagree, instead of repeatedly pushing your beliefs, you respected mine and allowed me to shift conversation away, which enabled us to accomplish more work and get more done. I really look forward to working wth you again."

Specific feedback:

You would sometimes complete my sentences but you would often say something different than I was going to say.  This put me in a position of having to decide between going along with your thought and never finishing what I started to say, or starting the sentence over again.  In some situations I think that completing the other person's sentences can help communication but I felt that it usually hindered ours.

When I gave you feedback about being on time I feel that you were a bit defensive and dismissive.  You did say thank you, but you also said that you were against the whole idea of being punctual and that I needed to be more sensitive to our levels of privilege.  It's not that I don't think we should have had that conversation - I'm glad we did - but it did feel defensive in the sense that you were trying to justify your lateness.

I think it was inappropriate for you to bring up Nazi Germany when I said that efficiency was a benefit of punctuality.  I felt like you were trying to associate me with Hitler because I value efficiency.

When we were talking about privilege there were times that I didn't feel safe.  I felt like you were waiting for me to say the wrong thing so you could let loose your arsenal.

Technical feedback:

I encourage you to try to be extremely precise when talking about technical things.  I recommend reading the mdn js documentation regularly to get used to the words they use and how precise they are.  This would help develop a better js foundation as well.

One specific weaknesses I noticed was not being clear on the difference between `myFunction` and `myFunction()`.  The first is the function itself and the second is the function being called."

We have the same learning needs, as far as conceptually. You understood my need to hear the details about functionality paired with the bigger picture every time there was a new concept. This is a conversation that I will take into orienting with my team from now on, because its super helpful to know how to talk about new concepts before we work together. If we work together again, (fingers crossed), I would want to stretch us both into applying the Pomodoro method. Working for 50 minutes and taking a 10 minute break.

I hope we get to work on a project closer to our optimal ZPD soon and as an aside I think your style and passion for aesthetic will make you a top-notch developer when it comes to stylistic decisions, and if you stay as passionate as you are now, your backend and middleware skills will totally match your front-end intuition! My only other feedback would be that at time it felt hard to stay on task because of internet distractions, which pulled me out of focus and would have helped me to have more intentional designated ""distraction time"" or ""bio/media breaks""."

I enjoyed our flow of problem solving and bouncing ideas off of each other. If I could give you bonus points in the “bringing fun to group culture”, I would. I appreciate how, when we experienced that group disconnect, you a) made efforts to redirect what we were working on and b) took a walk, returned and discussed it. Seems like that process worked for you, and it definitely worked for me as your teammate, to address issues as they come up and work through them.
Good times, keep being awesome!"

I felt uplifted by your enthusiasm for pushing into new territory, moving quickly, but also upholding a high standard for code. I loved it when you brought some vulnerable sharing to the morning standup. I also really appreciated how you held space to talk through feelings when things got intense. You were fun and not too serious at all, I felt we had a relaxed, humorous and focused flow that accelerated all of our learning. I look forward to working with you again!"

You were always up to contribute what you knew and I admire you sticking around even when under the weather most of the week.

You were not very encouraging considering your handle of the material. When we'd make mistakes or we reached a point of confusion you would figuratively snatch the keyboard and take control of the dialog (even after mere seconds of hearing the other team member start navigating), this did not happen every time but it happened enough to notice. You were also a bit stubborn and were almost never open to suggestions made by your teammates. You grew a little antagonistic when bothered by the way things were going, such as when the rest of the team switched to a front-end task and you felt it wasn’t worth the time spent. You grew silent, disconnected yourself from the project and would make snide remarks up till we walked away from the front-end and back into your realm of competence. We’re all still learning so a little patience goes a long way. I’d love to work with you in the future to see some progress in these areas."

You were always on time in the mornings and coming back from breaks. You constantly communicated with me, asking me if I was ready to start working again, reassuring me that when you were quiet it wasn't because you were frustrated, and just generally voicing your thought process as you worked. Keep up that fantastic communication, it made me feel like you were committed to my success and our shared success as a team. I enjoy your level of technical skill as well, you clearly know what you're doing and how to figure things out, and you aren't afraid of a challenge. You're flexible, specifically with calling in professional players, other learners, and with letting me take breaks as needed, and that makes me feel comfortable working with you. There's nothing that I think you could improve upon, keep being hungry and stepping up to challenges an you'll be all good."

This week was an amazing growth experience, and I owe that to how easygoing, flexible, and communicative you were. I also VERY much appreciated you keeping me accountable for my own self-care by making it clear that wasn't a pinch for you, giving me space to make sure that when we were working directly together I could be at 100%. It was also great the way that we planned our mornings around the fact that getting here reliably at 8:30 was a goal for both of us. I felt like we were very mutually supportive in working towards that goal. I'd want to work with you more if you didn't share my weak point regarding project progress. I know that we both could have been a little more proactive about getting the project spec done early and then doing extra work, rather than focusing on individual study and putting off finishing until the end of the week - but I also know via our communication earlier in the week that this was what we both wanted to do, and understand the tradeoff involved. I think that as long as all teammates understand and are intentional about those tradeoffs it's totally okay to make them."
