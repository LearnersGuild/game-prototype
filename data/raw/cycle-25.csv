Excellent week with ya. From the start, you got us off to a good start by encouraging check-ins and check-outs, and you brought your genuine self to all of these chats.

I appreciated how you presented a model around how to approach each problem that had worked for you in the past (logic-talk before coding); it served us well.

Thanks for being flexible when little things came up and I had to step away for a moment. As we turn up the heat in the home stretch, I challenge you (and me) to reduce things that interrupt and interfere with out work here."

It seemed that you were very distracted and unable to show up completely ready and focused on our project. I like your insight and willingness to be our mentor for DB cog app. I would like to work with you more if you show up ready to rock, remain in integrity with the time commitments and cog app you agree to. The project was broken trying to integrate backend and frontend. I was disappointed that you abandoned the project. It was a set back for the team. I was really excited about working with you and would LOVE to work with you again when you are able to be more present. You're really brilliant and your voice is important here. I appreciate your presence at the guild. I hope whatever you're going through, you find safety here and in the outside world."

You have a really good knowledge of the project and how everything goes together.  I appreciate your dedication to getting that Selenium stuff done.  I also found you to be very kind and accepting.

I know it was largely due to the tasks we were working on and the environment where we were working, (and myself being in a withdrawn mood much of the week) but I wish we'd had more of a chance to work together.  I know, for myself, I have a harder time focusing when I'm not working with someone. 

We also fell into the pattern of the person who knows a task best is always the one driving, and I normally prefer the reverse (Not that that is necessarily your problem.  Just kind of an observation about the week).
 I think you could work on your ability to explain things and give directions, though perhaps we just didn't get to work in the circumstances where that would have come up.

Also, I would have appreciated better communication in the mornings when you are running late.  There were a couple days where we hadn't heard anything from you before 9."

One area of improvement - when we're working in parallel on separate issues you can still ask me for input or support before going elsewhere - there were some questions you had for Jared that I had the answers to too. :p"

This helped me to keep from getting frustrated myself, and allowed me to dive deeper and deeper into unknown territory (oAuth) without fear of burdening or frustrating my team. I like that you asked questions about the process we had, and made attempts to talk out potential solutions, even though I ""shot you down"" a few times, you didn't take it personally and understood/became more curious to the underlying reason for why any given idea might or might not be good for the project. The way you handle learning will get you far.

I would want to work with you again if you become more self-confident. Although this might simply come all on its own from gathering more experience, I feel you sometimes shoot yourself down early. Don't judge a fish by it's ability to fly: Your skill in programming and syntax comes second, what you already have is your ability to problem solve, and you made that apparent when asking questions about when a for loop goes where etc. Breaking habits is difficult; 
I feel like you apologized very often when you've done nothing wrong, and that makes me feel mildly uncomfortable. But I'm not sure why. Take with a grain of salt - and feel free to ask me in person if you want me to go into more detail."

If it weren't for your idea to navigate and drive I don't think our team experience would've been the same.

I loved working with you this last week. I think we had a really good dynamic, and we were able to accomplish all of our goals, and have a little time to play around on Friday with the design. You were very open to suggestions, and to different learning styles. You answered my questions, and slowed down when I wasn't sure what was going on. 
I'd like to work with you again if you sneezed less. hahaha But in all seriousness, it would have been nice to drive a little bit when writing out the React code. I realized at the end of the week that I watched a lot, and it might have been helpful to get that tactile practice."

I felt like you never got frustrated when we couldn't solve a problem and you always had a new idea for pushing the project forward. I really enjoyed the calm environment that we maintained as a team while still having a lot of fun. My only feedback is that you may have kept working at some points where you would have been better off asking for help and it may have lead to overthinking a simple problem. That's a difficult thing to be able to identify as a beginner and I think with more experience you'll definitely know when you've hit a wall! Keep up the good work :)

You created the process that allowed us to get on the same and to avoid many major obstacles. Thank you for that.

I believe the earlier part of the week and the process we used produced better outcomes for team dynamics then the navigator/driver process we used later in the week. I believe the dynamic used at the end of the week gave less space for opposing ideas. I would want to work with you more if you were open to trust different processes and be willing to adapt your processes more dynamically."

I also enjoyed that socially on the team you asked for space and you apologized for taking space which makes it easier to trust that you will stick to agreements.

Working with you was fun, especially because you interested in understanding what you did and not just how to do it.

I admired your focus to the project, even with the multiple interferences we had all week long.

Remember to not worry about how much more someone else might know. There's always someone else you knows more than you and you also know more than someone else when it comes to all areas in life (including programming)."

I don't have a lot of feedback for you cause you have the right attitude to be a software developer and your communication skills are very good. My only technical feedback is to practice styling as you write your code and the best way to do it is to always ask yourself can someone else read my code and fully understand it? if you keep that question with you along the way you write your code you'll be unstoppable. 
Best of luck to you bro, you'll do great!!"
