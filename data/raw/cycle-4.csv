When we were in the zone, we made changes to the project quickly and synced what we needed to be doing easily. You are a very smart and charismatic guy. You were able to pick up on tensions and agree what was appropriate to do at times.

I would want to work with you more if you were able to be more flexible with a teammate when they went towards a direction on the code that you did not like or understand. 

Also if you truly do not understand what is going on, it is easier to ask the person coding such as the team lead at that moment then to try to understand code later on when we might not see things right away.  

It might be a good idea to discuss with your future teams about solo work during the week since you enjoy it. There is time and space for all kinds of ways to learn and create code."

-You think out loud, are able to self analyze in the moment and bring your self back to the topic at hand. 

-I liked how you and I were on similar planes of thinking when you were in COG APP mode. I was able to see what you were thinking of creating and catching any mistakes that might have been made in syntax because the code was readable to me. 

-I like your many systems and resources/boards on trello/white boards with time slots to help organize the teams this week. 

I would like to work with you more if:

-You didn't take things so seriously at times. I believe you noticed yourself joking, laughing, and enjoying creating the code we made together in COG APP. At times I like to joke to break down any tensions and keep things going smoothly. It seemed like that is still a pinch with you sometimes. 

-Also I would like if there was more of an explanation of the code that you created I understand that due to being split between 3 teams with 3 separate projects did not lend itself to make it easy to be able to do this.

-Notice yourself not paying attention to one or another person that may be with you while in Cog app or conversations with more then 1 person. 

-you had more experience working with more teams to be able to help all teams more effectively.

It was a pleasure to learn with someone this week who was organized in process during coding. I also thought Rachel was really open to taking time for learning throughout the week in order to push the project forward. I would want to work with Rachel more if she was more open to suggestions. My learning process is sometimes a bit messy and is very much about learning from mistakes and I was afraid to make them this week.
