So, if possible try and get more rest. 

As I write this I'm realizing this feedback might land in a frustrating way. especially if you cant free up more of yourself than you are. If thats the case please just keep doing what you're doing because I can tell you're doing your best.

I want to work with you because you brought me back to C++ days, you are very smart and work well with others. You taught me how to focus and I want to work like you do!

I would want to work with you more if you sometimes were more flexible with others also and I think you did learn that somewhat this week.

Thanks,

Harman"

You are also a great partner and are very present while pairing and are open to new ideas and have an easy going attitude which is very refreshing. I would want to work with you more if you wanted to push on while in those times of frustration, which was definitely worth it when we made those crucial breakthroughs.

I would want to work with you more if you clarified what you want to focus on learning related to project completeness. On Thursday, I thought we should have focused more on the design of the project in order to have higher quality and I felt you were too focused on learning express/database stuff at risk of quality.

Setting small goals for us (like ""I don't want to help you with git for the rest of the week"") pushes us to do better even when we don't realize that that's something we need to do. You also push us to have quality code and explain how code can be improved (by refactoring, by not using a particular Javascript method, etc)."

You push through and are highly motivated. I really enjoyed working this week with you because it felt like we had a flow to how we worked and things jelled together well between us and I would want to work with you more if you deepened your knowledge about algorithms."

I also enjoy learning how you solve/figure out how to solve problems. Being part of that process has been very helpful.

The only thing that I noticed that I want differently is that you talked to only one person during cog. app. It was not a major situation, but I felt it at times."

I would like to work with you more if you really focused on the interpersonal aspect of team work. It seemed to me that you stretched yourself this week to work in collaboration with a team member, which was really great to see.  I saw a few interactions this week where you were so intent on communicating your message that it seemed as if you were not considering *how* that message was being heard by your team mate. Related to this, I would suggest paying attention to your body language - you often communicate tension with posture, sighs, and other signs of frustration that affects the mood of the team."
