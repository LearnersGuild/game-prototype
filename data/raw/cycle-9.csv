We got lots done mostly in parallel. You are able to push ahead and focus on starting from scratch and push yourself into high ZPD levels.

I would want to work with you more if you created some more structure for teammates to allow everyone to be able to contribute to the overall group. For instance, instead of saying whatever you think would help move our project forward, how about saying what you might want your teammate to work on/search to help with your current task. Also if we are code pairing, perhaps trying driver/navigator and playing both roles may help you to get higher team play/ cult. contribution stats if you want to increase those."

They acted in integrity. They helped to create and maintain clear accountabilities. They stood firm in their domain and power, and respected the domains of others.

Culture Positives

They enjoyed the work. They created more fun and enjoyment for us.

Culture Challenge

They were engaged. Their focus, dedication and motivation supported our team in staying on task.

I want to work with you because you crack me up and because you were a team player 100% throughout the project.  I would want to work with you more if you were more focused sometimes I felt like you distracted us a little bit from getting work done, which was fun, but not as productive.

You were very responsive to my requests and preferences around how we paired and soloed, and you were communicative and flexible when we had differing opinions .
Your technical knowledge was invaluable, and you always had good ideas on how to improve our project. I learned a lot from you.
We were able to get into flow and cover some serious territory. You’re fun to work with, and you crack me up.
Hard to think of “would want to work with you more”. I think, early on, we may have been more efficient if we’d looked at existing code and tutorials rather than dive in headfirst with our existing knowledge. But even that is something I admire—I tend to avoid getting messy, hacking, and refactoring later, and that’s a skill I want to improve. 
Thanks for a great week."

You gave great jokes and you laughed at my comebacks. Thanks. They were authentic and real. They were being themselves which inspired us to be ourselves.

[Culture] They challenged themselves and others. They sought out growth for themselves, and helped everyone extend their potential.
[Team Play] They were open to feedback, and received it gracefully without becoming defensive or dismissive. 

I would want to work with you more if:
[Culture] They challenged themselves and others. They sought out growth for themselves, and helped everyone extend their potential.
[Team Play] They stepped into leadership roles when needed, and supported others to step into leading roles.

I wrote the same thing for culture - I love seeing you continue to challenge yourself to take on new problems, and just wanted to reinforce that I hope you continue to do that!  We can work on refining the cycle goals to ensure you're not taking on too much in a given cycle, but keep on trying the hard problems, and learning from them!  For team play, I am also seeing a lot of improvement in your willingness to be heard when you have input, and wanted to point that out and ensure you continue to challenge yourself in that area."

It's clear that you have no problem challenging yourself, but sometimes I sense the focus is a little too much on challenge, and not enough on internalizing the knowledge.  I think as we practice estimation, and start to understand the actual scope of projects we are signing up for, this will get to better.

They helped to create and maintain clear accountabilities.
They were constantly looking for ways to improve team process, and to help everyone play to their full potential.
It was great working with you this week, and I learned a lot I just think that I would need a little bit more guidance to see what I should be able to produce in order to stay on schedule for the project without having to rely solely on your expertise, but I suppose that will happen as I gain more experience and skills. It was definitely great working with you this week and i feel as if I am learning a lot because of it. Maybe something that would be nice is to be able to go over code that is refactored and clearly see the difference between the original code and the more efficient, refactored code, so that I can see the difference more clearly and start thinking in that sense as well. But definitely, I appreciate the fact that you dod refactor the code to make it more concise and precise and I see the value of doing that in order to make the functionality more efficient. And so thank you for taking the time to do that."
